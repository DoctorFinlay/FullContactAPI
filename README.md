# FullContactAPI

N.B. You will need a FREE API key from FullContact.com - once you have it, there is a comment showing you where to put it in the Constants.swift file

I built this app to practise the following:

1) Practising connecting to a different RESTful API
2) Using an enum to make parsing out the JSON easier to read
3) Using Kingfisher to display images from a URL
